# Machine configuration on Windows

Machine configuration for my Samsung Ativ Book 9 plus.

## `clickpad-config.reg`

This disables the "regular right click mouse" when a click is made in the bottom right area of the clickpad to make the entire clickpad left-clickable. This also enables the "regular middle click mouse" when a click is made with three fingers.

See elan-clickpad-settings.txt for more information.


##`WindowsTimeFixUTC.reg`

This prevents the clock to be changed by Windows when switching from/to Ubuntu.
